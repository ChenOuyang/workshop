    "In this session, we are going to familiarise ourselves with micromagnetics, Python, and Jupyter and we are going to spend most of the time looking at slides. Slides can be found in `slides` directory in the workshop [repository](https://github.com/ubermag/workshop). After slides (and a short break), we are going to write our first ubermag simulation and have a look at some Python basics.\n",
