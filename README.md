## About

This repository is the "place-to-start-at" for new Ubermag users. Here we share all information and materials about Ubermag workshops and communicate with the participants using `Issues`. This is a public repository and all its content can be seen and downloaded by everybody. Therefore, you do not need a GitHub account to be able to download anything. However, if you want to ask a question or request support, you are going to need a GitHub account, which is free and very easy to create.

## Materials

1. Slides used during workshops can be found in `slides` directory. We do not split the slides into separate files for each session, so all the slides are always going to be in a single PDF file.
*(PDF slides do not have animations to ensure the files are of reasonable size and accessible by everybody. If you want the presentation in original Keynote (or exported PowerPoint) format, please raise an issue and we will find a way of sharing them with you.)*

2. Tutorials and exercises as Jupyter notebooks are available in `tutorials` directory. Those notebooks are the ones you see when you open Binder.

3. In `extras` directory, we share all the other materials, which do not belong to `slides` or `tutorials`.

## Future workshops

There are no scheduled workshops at the moment.

## Binder

Tutorials can be used in the cloud via Binder. To access Binder, use the badge in the table above.

## YouTube

YouTube video tutorials are available on the [Ubermag channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7MSqVQSMFV42R1jAYmKGLg).

## Support

If you require support, have questions, want to report a bug, or want to suggest an improvement, please raise an issue in [ubermag/help](https://github.com/ubermag/help) repository.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome, however small they are. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request. If you are not sure how to contribute, please contact us by raising an issue in [ubermag/help](https://github.com/ubermag/help) repository, and we are going to help you get started and assist you on the way.

## What happens after the workshop?

After each workshop, we make a release (a snapshot of the repository as it was at the end of workshop). You can find the it under "releases". This allows you to download a zip-file of all the materials.

All issues (questions and answers) are going to stay in this repository, so you can refer to them at any time.

We ask all participants to keep asking questions in our dedicated [support repository](https://github.com/ubermag/help).
