## About

This repository is a place where the materials used in Ubermag workshops are collected.

## How to join?

The current workshop taking place is divided into 3 sessions:

1. 24 April 2020, 14:00-15:30 - Micromagnetics basics, Python, Jupyter
2. (date to be announced later) Simulations with Ubermag
3. (date to be announced later) Data analysis and visualisation

The workshop will delivered using [Zoom](https://zoom.us). Please install it before the workshop and join the session using this [link](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74465485256).

To follow the tutorials and do the exercises, you can use Binder. We recommend using Google Chrome as a web browser.

## Documentation

Jupyter notebooks are available as a part of documentation.

## Binder

The tutorials and exercises can be used in the cloud. This does not require to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine. To access Binder, use the Binder badge in the table above.
