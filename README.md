## About

This repository is a place where the materials (slides, tutorials, and exercises) used in Ubermag workshops are collected.

## Current workshop

The current workshop taking place is divided into 3 sessions:

1. Friday 24 April 2020, 14:00-15:30 - Micromagnetics basics, Python, Jupyter
2. Wednesday 29 April 2020, 14:00-15:30 Simulations with Ubermag
3. (date to be announced later) Data analysis and visualisation
4. (optional follow-up session depending on the requests and feedback)

## What to do before the workshop?

1. The workshop will delivered using [Zoom](https://zoom.us). Please install [Zoom](https://zoom.us) before the workshop and join the session using this [link](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/74465485256). There is no need to create an account with Zoom.

2. To access the files in this repository, you do not need a GitHub. However, if you want to contribute to Ubermag or raise questions, you are going to need an account.

3. To follow the tutorials and exercises, you do not need to install anything on your machine or download (clone) this repository. The tutorials and exercises can be run in the cloud and no files will be created on your machine. The cloud service is provided using Binder and it can be accessed using Binder badge in the table above. WARNING: The most recent update of Safari browser on MacOS in some cases does not interpret the colours well in 3D interactive plots. Therefore, we recommend using Google Chrome.

## Documentation

Rendered tutorials as Jupyter notebooks are available as a part of documentation.
