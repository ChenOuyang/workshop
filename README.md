  - Ryan A. Pepper, and
  - [Hans Fangohr](https://fangohr.github.io)

## Workshop information

The current workshop is organised by [Spintalks](https://www.spintalks.org/home) and [IEEE Magnetic Society](http://www.ieeemagnetics.org). It is a free workshop and it is open for scientists and students working in magnetism and magnetic materials fields. To subscribe, please send an email to [listserv@listserv.unl.edu](listserv@listserv.unl.edu) with `subscribe oommf-tutorial Full Name` in the body of the message (replace "Full Name" by your full name). After you send a subscription email, you are going to get a confirmation email and then, before each session, you are going to get a Zoom registration request. Please register for each session and you are going to be sent a Zoom session link. In addition to Zoom, the tutorial sessions will be broadcast live at https://www.twitch.tv/onlinespintronics. The recording of each live broadcast will be available on Twitch immediately after each session.

The workshop consists of 3 sessions:

1. Thursday, June 18 2020, 12:00-13:30 (ET) - Introduction to micromagnetics and Ubermag  
2. Thursday, June 25 2020, 12:00-13:30 (ET) - Micromagnetic models and drivers in Ubermag
3. Thursday, July 02 2020, 12:00-13:30 (ET) - Data analysis and visualisation

(12:00 in New York = 17:00 in London = 18:00 in Paris) In each session, there is going to be a 5-10 minutes break, approximately after the first 45 minutes.

## What to do before the workshop?

1. Subscribe (if you have not done it already) by following instructions in "Workshop information" section.

2. The workshop will delivered using [Zoom](https://zoom.us). Please install it before the workshop.

3. To follow the tutorials and exercises, you do not need to install anything on your machine or download (clone) this repository. The tutorials and exercises can be run in the cloud and all you need is a web browser (we recommend Google Chrome) and internet connection. Ubermag in the cloud can be accessed using Binder badge in the table above. Please note that Binder is a free shared service and starting it can sometimes take a few minutes, so please be patient.

**WARNING:** The most recent update of Safari browser on MacOS sometimes does not deal with Jupyter widgets well and we recommend using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for running Ubermag in Jupyter.

## Materials

1. Slides used during the workshop can be found in `slides` directory. The slides are going to be in a single file, which is going to be extended before every session. *(PDF slides do not have animations in order to make sure the files are of reasonable size and accessible by everybody. If you want the presentation in Keynote or PowerPoint format, please raise an issue.)*

2. Tutorials and exercises as Jupyter notebooks are available in `tutorials` directory. More will be added as we go through the workshop.

3. In `extras` directory, we share all the materials we refer to when we answer questions.

If you require support, have questions, want to report a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have any criticism, please feel free to let us know. In order to make sure we stay organised as much as possible, we kindly ask all participants to ask questions in one of the two ways:

1. Raise an issue in this repository at any time. Please be aware that questions and answers in GitHub issues are publicly available, so please be careful not to share any personal information you do not want being public or any confidential research-related information.

2. During live sessions, please send your question to either Ryan A. Pepper or Hans Fangohr as a private message. During the live sessions Marijan Beg will go through the questions and answer some of them, depending on the time limitations and the number of questions. If your question is not answered, please raise an issue in this repository.
